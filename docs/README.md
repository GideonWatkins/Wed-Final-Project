# My Final Project

For my final project, I plan on making a website for an author. Many authors have websites of their own that they advertise, both online and in their novels, which showcase some of their completed works and share more about them as a person. As an author myself, one who hopes to publish his first book, I thought tinkering with this idea might end up being beneficial later on, if it were something I hoped to implement. Naturally, this author website would be one that advertises my works and tells readers more about me.

In a basic sense, this website would include things like a brief biography snippet, good-to-know info, projects I'm currently working on, as well as already-completed works. Each of these could be housed on a separate page. There could also be a link to buy books, and for the sake of the assignment, somewhere to drag and drop different titles into a cart for purchase. I believe there are ways to incoroprate all of the requirements into this website.

My first milestone will be to get the first page set up. This will give me a base to work with when deciding how the rest of the website will be created. Next, I will plan to have all of the pages created and link with a nav bar or something, as well as have the styling (CSS) finished. The following week, I will work on making the forms do what they're supposed to, adding event listeners and getting those to work; depending on how much I get done, this may or may not include drag and drop. The final week will be me finishing any items I have not completed.

(Maybe create a login or something where I can get in and change what is displayed. Save the books in 2 2D arrays where one is tobedisplayed and the other is notdisplayed, and I can drag and drop between the 2 and update what is shown; saves via api or localstorage. Can edit book details as well.)
